							<img style="float:left;padding: 5px 15px 5px 5px" src="images/nintendogs-mario-hat.gif" alt="A virtual Nintendog wearing a Mario hat lolls its head, in all its Nintendo DS cuteness" width="400" height="250"/><p>This week I chose to write about a case study from <strong>Roger</strong>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Diffusion of Innovation</em></strong> (2003), titled &ldquo;<strong>Nintendomania: Rapid Adoption of an Entertainment Innovation</strong>&rdquo;. I chose this article mostly because I find gaming&mdash;the games themselves, the gaming industry, and the unbelievably vast culture surrounding gaming&mdash;fascinating. Plus, for about a year of my childhood, I begged my mom incessantly for a Nintendo DS so I could play the puppy dream game <em>Nintendogs</em>. Mom didn&rsquo;t cave, but this experience makes me a firsthand witness to the absolute vice grip Nintendo&rsquo;s marketing had on kids during the 1990s-2000s, which also drew me to this article.</p>
<hr />

<p>Roger's (2003) case study examines the unprecedented diffusion of Nintendo&rsquo;s gaming systems in the years following their 1986 launch in the United States. Just how unprecedented was the adoption of the Nintendoverse? &ldquo;Nintendomania&rdquo; is no exaggeration:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&ldquo;In the seven years following the introduction of this innovation in the United States in 1986, an unbelievable 50 million Nintendos were sold; they were found in about one-third of all U.S. households, representing practically every American family with boys. In comparison, only about half as many U.S. households adopted a personal computer (actually, the Nintendo game-player is a computer, carefully disguised), after twice as many years of diffusion. [&hellip;] In 1992, Nintendo's U.S. sales were responsible for 10 percent of the immense U.S.-Japanese trade deficit!&rdquo; (p. 246).</p>
<p>Before entering the US market, Nintendo, a century-old company headquartered in Kyoto, had already established commercial success in its native Japan through the carefully choregraphed introduction of its &ldquo;Famicom&rdquo; family computer. With a honed razor-and-razor blade strategy, Nintendo amassed a growing arsenal of entertaining&mdash;and most importantly, <em>lucrative</em>&mdash;games premised on street fighting, racing, sports, and everyone&rsquo;s favorite cheeky Italian plumber, Mario. After conquering the Japanese video game market, Nintendo president Yamauchi selected his son-in-law, Minoru Arakawa, to lead the company&rsquo;s US introduction. The not an overnight success, Nintendo&rsquo;s rapid and widespread diffusion in the US helped cement the company&rsquo;s global legacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As suggested in the article, we can read Nintendo&rsquo;s rapid diffusion in the US market as a masterful execution of <strong>Roger&rsquo;s five perceived attributes of innovation</strong>, the characteristics which are positively associated with the rate of innovation adoption. The five attributes are: <strong>relative advantage</strong>, or the extent to which an innovation is viewed as superior to its perceived predecessors; <strong>compatibility</strong>, or the extent to which an innovation is understood as compatible with extant technical and sociocultural norms and needs; <strong>complexity</strong>, or the perceived degree of difficulty associated with a given innovation; <strong>observability</strong>, or how readily observable the innovation&rsquo;s results are to would-be adopters; and finally, <strong>trialability</strong>, which refers to the availability of trial use opportunities for a given innovation (Sahin, 2006).</p>
<p>Zooming out to consider Nintendomania from a 2022 vantage, the parallels are obvious. The diffusion of video gaming is virtually (no pun intended) unparalleled in its completeness, having managed to integrate itself into nearly every nook and cranny of the wider new media landscape. Whether you&rsquo;re playing <em>Farmville</em> or <em>CandyCrush</em> or <em>Animal Crossing </em>or <em>Red Dead</em>, you&rsquo;re gaming. Undeniably, gaming culture is ubiquitous, and its mass adoption within mainstream society has produced a hegemonic effect on traditional art and media and led to the creation of new media applications&mdash;most notably Twitch&mdash;which has in turn spawned its own constellation of digital subcultures (University of Minnesota Libraries, 2016).</p>
<p>This mutually constructive exchange between gaming and mainstream cultures affords us a new perspective from which we might consider our own subjectivity and agency in digital culture, which in turn offers real-world insights. Without getting too psychoanalytical, I know that the hours I&rsquo;ve spent cultivating my farm and building relationships with my NPC neighbors in <em>Stardew Valley</em> are probably more rooted in my own desire for pastoral simplicity and less screentime than I&rsquo;d care to unpack. Expounding this notion of virtual self-exploration, Žižek posits that gameplay allows us to dabble in obscenity and immortality&mdash;and even more abstractly, to experiment with a sort of atemporal volition&mdash;while immersing ourselves &ldquo;in a universe of undeadness where no annihilation is definitive since, after every destruction, [we] can return to the beginning and start the game again&rdquo; (Žižek, 2017).</p>
<p>Similarly, Bown (2017) argues that freedom in any game is merely illusory, and that just as the we operate games, games operate us. In essence, while we might feel that games offer us an opportunity to explore ourselves and dabble in our desires, these experiences take place within finite synthetic realms, and in our modern area, increasingly <em>corporatized</em> synthetic realms. Indeed, early projections estimate the gaming industry will generate more than $260 billion in revenue by 2025, and tech giants Google, Meta, and Apple all plan to enter the gaming industry in the coming years (Beattie, 2021). All this to say: no matter your opinion on cybernetic musings, the exponential growth of the gaming industry suggests a booming desire for entertainment in the form of increasingly elaborate gameplay and virtual realities, and as an increasingly digital civilization, philosophers and economists alike will certainly derive meaning and insight from trends in entertainment and gaming innovation.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to Nintendomania and Roger&rsquo;s attributes of innovation, has the total saturation of gaming culture&mdash;the result of a meticulously curated business strategy, replicated in countless permutations since Nintendo&rsquo;s US launch&mdash;preemptively satisfied the conditions needed for rapid diffusion of new innovations? Extant research supports the plausibility of this notion (Hern&aacute;ndex et. al, 2017), and within this rationale, video games have been used as a tool for exploring the rate of adoption among various sociodemographic populations (Gray, 2012).</p>
<p>In the tradition of innovation, where will gaming take us next? How will gaming continue to disrupt and influence legacy media, established institutions, and our cultural psyche? Will Bethesda ever actually release <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>? We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

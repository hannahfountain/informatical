							<h1><strong><em>On Bitcoin</em></strong></h1>
							<h3>by Hannah Fountain | July 7, 2022 | INSC 542</h3>
<p><em>This blog post is inspired by and attempts to build on Shakhatreh's 2022 article, "Bitcoin: It's Concept, Characteristics and Impact on Trade and Global Economy". My interest in both the article and topic stems from a desire to better understand the discourse and technical aspects involving the ongoing crypto collapse that has received extensive media coverage and commentary here in the United States.</em></p>

							<p>The stated purpose of this article is to study the concept of bitcoin as well as its impact on trade and the global economy. To this end, Shakhatreh evaluates the major conceptualizations of Bitcoin, deriving three key tenets. Firstly, the currency&rsquo;s digital intangibility is its most prominent characteristic. Second, unlike many extant mobile banking currencies, Bitcoin does not hail from a physical precursor and does not exist in a physical manifestation. And finally, its &ldquo;peer to peer&rdquo; model mean that users interact with the technology without any kind of &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo;, meaning that &ldquo;all transactions in the Bitcoin network occur without going through a trusted third party &lsquo;TTP&rsquo; or a financial institution, such as a bank or even authority like government&rdquo; (p.36).</p>
<p>Shakhatreh proceeds with weighing the pros and cons of the crypto giant, beginning with five major advantages offered by Bitcoin:<em> lower fees</em>, as opposed to traditional money sending via banks or transactions between customers and merchants; <em>transparency and neutrality</em>, attributed to the existence of an encrypted global public ledger;<em> privacy and confidentiality, </em>referring to the swiftness and anonymity granted by a lack of supervision and regulation; <em>global capacity</em>, attributed to its decentralization and international opportunity; and lastly, <em>low risk of collapse</em>, which the author attributes to a lack of regulation.</p>
<p>To borrow an Internet colloquialism, there&rsquo;s <em>a lot</em> to unpack here<em>.</em> From the outset, it seems worth noting that most of these proposed advantages assume the conditions of sufficiently high-ICT penetration, technological accessibility, and honed digital literacy. That is to say, the advantages of Bitcoin only exist for those with the requisite skills, resources, and means by which to realize them, notwithstanding the influence of sociodemographic criterion on those conditions. So, with that in mind, let&rsquo;s dive in and dissect these advantages.</p>
<p>First up: lower fees. The notion that Bitcoin circumvents or reduces the fees associated with traditional banking is misleading. Bitcoin can only be acquired through a cryptocurrency trading exchange platform, which involves an assortment of fees that are often charged per transaction and vary greatly (<a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-bitcoin/">Harr, 2022</a>). Similarly, network fees fluctuate according to price volatility and blockchain traffic, a structure designed to incentive Bitcoin miners to consistently process transactions and participate in the voluntary blockchain network via the resource-intense process of Bitcoin mining (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-and-its-many-fees-what-to-know-about-the-hidden-costs-of-digital-currency-11639825202">Vigna, 2021</a>).</p>
							<p>Those voluntary coin miners&mdash;who, when collectivized, form a what&rsquo;s called a <em>mining pool</em>&mdash;oversee an arsenal of <em>mining rigs</em>, a term which serves as crypto shorthand for &lsquo;powerful computers equipped with cooling fans&rsquo; that expend enormous amounts of energy to do one thing as quickly and efficiently as possible: generate as many <em>nonces</em> (numbers only used once) as needed to satisfy the 64-digit hexadecimal target hash, securing a new block, and in turn, additional Bitcoin for the crypto market (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work">Hong, 2022</a>). Once a new block is successfully mined, all the metadata associated with that activity, along with any subsequent sales and resales, is recorded and preserved immutably in the blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology represents the most well-known form of distributed ledger technology (DLT), a type of digital recordkeeping which leverages the use of independent computers or <em>nodes</em> to document and synchronize transactions in their respective ledgers to achieve public transparency. Shakhatreh highlights the blockchain DLT&rsquo;s transparency as an advantage of the service, and for the most part, I&rsquo;m inclined to agree. Blockchain, and more DLT writ large, has the potential to disrupt and revolutionize traditionally centralized financial sector services, making them more efficient, transparent, and, in theory, tamperproof (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialsector/brief/blockchain-dlt">World Bank Group, 2018</a>). In the abstract, the immutability of blockchain technology can be attributed to each block&rsquo;s unique cryptographic hash and the node network&rsquo;s consensus protocol process, in which nodes mutually construct their shared ledger, making it essentially impossible for anyone to build up enough computing power to subvert the network (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/25/143246/how-secure-is-blockchain-really/">Orcutt, 2018</a>).</p>
<p>Despite these seemingly airtight security measures, many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been exploited in a variety of astonishingly crafty technical hacks which largely targeting the technological infrastructure which mediates their acquisition and purchase, like digital wallets and crypto trading platforms. Digital thieves stole an estimated $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, and are on track to surpass that total in 2022, with some loss estimates projected near $5.2 billion (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/newsletters/ettech-unwrapped/defi-fo-fum-hackers-find-new-ways-to-gobble-up-crypto/articleshow/91013473.cms?from=mdr">Franko, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>Still, the public ledger and community ethos of the blockchain can be surprisingly effective in identifying hackers. By now we&rsquo;ve all probably heard about the Bitifinex hack, widely speculated to be the single largest crypto heist in history per some valuations. In 2016, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan hacked Bitifinex servers to obtain cryptographic keys, which were then used to transfer 119,754 Bitcoins to addresses they controlled on the blockchain. Lichtenstein and Morgan had successfully wiped most of their digital DNA from the crime scene, save for the 34-character anonymous addresses on the blockchain where they had sent the stolen Bitcoins. In an effort to recruit the blockchain community&rsquo;s assistance, Bitifinex put those addresses on the internet, and in 2016, an IRS agent working out of his basement in Grand Rapids traced them to a crypto wallet owned by Ilya Lichtenstein and Razzlekh&mdash;sorry, Heather Morgan (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-30/how-the-world-s-biggest-bitcoin-btc-hack-at-bitfinex-got-botched">Faux, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>The example of the Bitifex hack, wherein in executives <em>knew</em> the blockchain addresses of the culprits but had no further identifying information, is a useful entry point from which to observe the convoluted nature of anonymity on the blockchain. Sure, anonymity has its perks, but maximizing privacy on the blockchain requires a fair amount of technical savvy, and as multiple studies have demonstrated, privacy on the blockchain isn&rsquo;t as simple or secure as it might appear (<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/596.pdf">Androulaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00916.pdf">Conti et al., 2017</a>). However, Bitcoin&rsquo;s emphasis on privacy and confidentiality--features which Shakhatreh identifies as advantages--has been exploited by drug and sex traffickers. Earlier this year, the US Government Accountability Office reports a fivefold increase in drug trafficking crimes involving crypto since 2017, further citing crypto to be the second-most commonly accepted payment method in the online commercial sex market, which is widely used to facilitate sex trafficking, and finally estimating that 80-90% of Dark Web transactions are related to drugs, with crypto implicated in each and every transaction, as it is the Dark Web&rsquo;s only ubiquitous payment method (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedknutson/2022/01/10/crypto-increasingly-used-in-humandrug-trafficking-says-gao/?sh=79b52911637e">Knutson, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen so far, many of the suggested advantages contain paradoxical qualities which overlap with one another, and Shakhatreh&rsquo;s final proposed advantages are no exception. On Bitcoin&rsquo;s potential for global expansion, Shakhatreh writes, &ldquo;Bitcoin is not restricted to a specific country or continent [&hellip;] no country can prohibit it, therefore no one can block these transactions or transfers [&hellip;] because only its owner has the power to determine the mechanism, place and type of its use&rdquo; (p. 37). Moreover, on Bitcoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;low risk of collapse&rdquo;, Shakhatreh reasons that because &ldquo;regular currencies rely on governments that sometimes fail to protect their currency, such events either cause hyperinflation or a complete collapse of the currency which can wipe out the lifetime savings in one day&rdquo; (p. 38), further positioning Bitcoin as a safe harbor from economic instability due to its unregulated status.</p>
<p>Though crypto and DLT continue to inspire hope for globally accessible, economically stable virtual currencies, it seems dubious that Bitcoin will be the crypto innovation to realize this vision. It seems that Bitcoin is ultimately not immune to regulatory action, as cryptocurrency has been subject to implicit bans in at least 42 countries, and absolute bans in at least 9 nations, including China (<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llglrd/2021687419/2021687419.pdf">Library of Congress, 2021</a>). Only two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, have adopted Bitcoin as a national currency. In 2021, El Salvador&rsquo;s president Nayib Bukele adopted Bitcoin as the official legal tender and personally invested more than $100 million in the cryptocurrency, hoping to simultaneously increase digital inclusion and greater financial literacy among Salvadorans while positioning his the country as an early adopter, poised to reap the anticipated benefits of a booming crypto economy (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/19/1106168947/what-the-crypto-collapse-means-for-el-salvadors-economy">NPR, 2022</a>). Unfortunately, this vision has failed to materialize. A March survey by the county&rsquo;s Chamber of Commerce in March found that just 14% of Salvadoran businesses made crypto transactions since its official designation, while only 3% percent said they perceived any business value in it; moreover, El Salvador&rsquo;s central bank found that the digital currency payment apps obligatory in facilitating crypto use accounted for less than 2% of overall remittances in the first half 0f 2022 (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/05/world/americas/el-salvador-bitcoin-national-currency.html">Kurmanaev &amp; Avelar, 2022</a>). Amid this summer&rsquo;s ill-timed gargantuan crypto collapse (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/29/crypto-crisis-digital-currencies-boom-collapse-bitcoin-terra">Hern &amp; Milmo, 2022</a>), it&rsquo;s hard to imagine such catastrophic fluctuation would inspire the confidence and enthusiasm needed to inspire the mass adoption President Bukele envisioned. In the Central Africa Republic, where the GDP per capita was just $511.5 in 2021 and internet penetration hovers around 11%, it&rsquo;s still too soon to say what effects the official recognition of Bitcoin will have on the national economy, with many geopolitical analysts and financial experts confused by the motivating factors at play (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23048142/bitcoin-adopted-official-currency-central-african-republic-car-why">Vincent, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>Shakhatreh raises more than a few of these arguments in the summarization of Bitcoin&rsquo;s disadvantages and risks. Specifically, the author points to Bitcoin&rsquo;s notoriously fluctuating value, the potential illegality associated with crypto use, the arduous and broadly inaccessible process of mining Bitcoin, and the potential opportunities for exploit via tax evasion or theft. Further, based on these findings, Shakhatreh recommends that relevant jurisdictional and governing bodies make sufficient legal, economic, and technical preparations to ensure the security of users sooner rather than later, and likewise, that national and global financial stakeholders begin monitoring trends and educating citizens for success in navigating with cryptocurrencies, ultimately recommending &ldquo;countries to put in place special legislation regulating dealing with Bitcoin&rdquo; (p. 40).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, I&rsquo;m sure it comes as no surprise that I agree with Shakhatreh&rsquo;s advice. To me, the merits of Bitcoin lie in the democratic opportunity of blockchain DLT, and in that sense, the potential is irrefutable. In fact, some have even compared it to now ubiquitous technologies like TCP/IP (<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain">Iansiti &amp; Lakhani, 2017</a>). Beyond crypto&rsquo;s technical merits, it seems that arguments for its widespread adoption often bare traces of Bitcoin maximalism, a flavor of technoutopianism unique to the crypto universe which often perceives crypto as a simple and convenient solution to many complex socioeconomic problems without much consideration of the variables and implications therein. Despite its stated decentralized ethos, in a crypto environment where just 0.1% of Bitcoin miners control half of all mining capacity (<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/26/bitcoin-mining-capacity-ownership-concentration-top-investors-nber-study/">Graffeo, 2021</a>), crypto volatility stands to worsen extant socioeconomic inequality (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-07/crypto-collapse-threatens-to-leave-black-hispanic-investors-further-behind#xj4y7vzkg">Cachero, 2022</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629621004813">Howsen &amp; de Vries, 2022</a>), and the energy-intensive mining process wreaks havoc on our environment (<a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/09/20/bitcoins-impacts-on-climate-and-the-environment/">Cho, 2021</a>), it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that Bitcoin is paving the way to the kind of equitable digital future any of us had hoped for.</p>
<p>To that effect, I&rsquo;d like to end by quoting Ben Tarnoff, who writes on the historical privatization of the Internet, and more broadly, our increasingly digital lives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>While the issues are various and complex, they are inextricable from the fact that the internet is owned by private firms and run for profit. And an internet owned by smaller, more entrepreneurial firms, more regulated firms will still be an internet run for profit. And an internet run for profit is one that can&rsquo;t guarantee people the things the need to lead self-determined lives. It&rsquo;s an internet where people can&rsquo;t participate in the decisions which affect them. It&rsquo;s an internet where the rewards flow to the few and the risks are borne by the many.</em>&nbsp;(Tarnoff, 2022, xxi).</p>
